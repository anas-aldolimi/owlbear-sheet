the website portion was not made by me but I can't find the original source.

A simple script that translates a 5ecompanionapp character sheet into a proper dnd character sheet.



# How to run

place your 5e companion app character into the main folder and rename it to character5e.json

run the deleter to clean up the character sheet template
```
python ./deleter.py
```

then run the main script:
```
python ./main.py
```

to view your sheet you can go to:

or run the website locally by typing
```npm run dev```
in your console after having nodejs installed.
